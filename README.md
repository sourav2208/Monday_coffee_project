## Objective ##
The aim of this project is to study the online sales data of Monday Coffee (since January 2023) and suggest the top three major cities in India where the company should open new coffee shops, based on customer demand and sales trends.

## Recommendation ##
City 1: Pune
* Brings in the most total revenue.
* Rent per customer is very low, which helps save costs.
* Each customer spends more on average, which is a good sign for business.

City 2: Delhi
* Has the highest number of potential coffee drinkers (around 7.7 million).
* Also has a high number of customers (68).
* Rent per customer is ₹330, which is still affordable.

City 3: Jaipur
* Has the most customers (69).
* Rent per customer is very low at ₹156, making it budget-friendly.
* Average sales per customer is ₹11.6K, showing good customer interest.
